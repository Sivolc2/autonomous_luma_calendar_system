## For Administrators

### Room Configuration

To update available rooms and buildings:

1. Navigate to `config/rooms.json`
2. Edit the JSON file structure:
   ```json
   {
     "buildings": {
       "540": {
         "address": "540 Laguna St, San Francisco, CA 94102",
         "rooms": [
           {
             "id": "hogwarts",
             "name": "Hogwarts Hall",
             "description": "Main event space"
           },
           // Add more rooms here...
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Save the file - changes will be reflected immediately

### Updating the Map

To update the Commons map:

1. Replace the file at `static/images/commons_map.png`
2. Make sure the new image:

   - Has a clear layout of all rooms
   - Is optimized for web (recommended size: 1000-1500px wide)
   - Has good contrast for readability
